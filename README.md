# Cardi-Mate
Cardi-Mate is a simple, lightweight app designed to measure heart rate. It addresses an opportunity to provide a tool that supports users in personalizing their healthcare experience with the goal of optimizing overall health and wellness.
The objective of this project is to provide users with an application that facilitates a better overview of their health and hygiene. This functionality will be achieved through the provision of a user interface that enables access to a tracker portal.
